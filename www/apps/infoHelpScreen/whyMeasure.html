    <p>In whatever we do, we will ensure that we are certain on what we are doing. So why do we need to use this Statistic Management System to help us in Measure? <b>Why do we Need Measure?</b></p>

    <p align="center">When we ignore measurement, we <b>risk overlooking</b> one of our critical roles as disciples: the role of “steward.” Here are <b>five ideas</b> that might help reconcile the stress between ministry and measurement: </p>
    </div>

    <p align="center"><b>1. God measures things and tells people to measure things as well </b></p>
    <p align="justify">The Bible is full of numbers. It even has a book called Numbers. Numbers don’t challenge our faith, they define its boundaries. If we removed the numbers from the examples above, these stories of faith and faithfulness would be reduced to broad generalities and anecdotal illustrations, losing much of their power to energize and encourage. It’s the numbers that provide a way for us to see the power and glory of God in a crystal clear manner. </p>

    <p align="center"><b>2. Measurement Is Tied to Motivation </b></p>
    <p align="justify">What we cannot measure, we cannot manage. What we cannot manage doesn’t motivate us. What doesn’t motivate us fails to attract our resources, time, and effort. We might go through the motions, but we will not truly invest ourselves—our energies, passion, personal sacrifice and long-term commitment—into something over which we have no influence. </p>

    <p align="center"><b>3. We Measure our part, We Report on God's part</b></p>
    <p align="justify">Our motive for measurement is effective management. If we come up lacking, we can take the initiative to remedy our approach. Measurements are the early warning radar system that can alert us to ministry effectiveness issues. The motive for measurement must always be directed towards our part of increased ministry effectiveness and for the purposes of glorifying God. As for God's part, we don’t measure it: we report on what we have seen Him do.</p>

    <p align="center"><b>4. The Motive of Measurement is Critically Important </b></p>
    <p align="justify">We can find several instances in the Bible where counting (measurement) and reporting led to disaster. One is found in II Samuel 24. David ordered a census and, even though remonstrated by a godly advisor, Joab, he proceeded to number the people.</p>

    <p align="center"><b>5. Without Measurement There is No Rest </b></p>
    <p align="justify">How do we know when to celebrate? Without measurements, we’re never sure of progress. There’s no finishing line. There’s no Sabbath from what we’re doing; no worship for what God is doing. Mesurements are the specifics of our prayers and the evidence that they have been answered. Clarity demands some type of metrics—it might be about time or speed, cost, quality, quantity.</p>
